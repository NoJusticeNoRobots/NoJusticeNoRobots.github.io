  <h2 class="w3-center">An Open Letter From Robotics Researchers</h2>
  <div class="w3-center" style="margin-top:64px; padding-left: 128px; padding-right: 128px">
    <p>Recent events have shone a spotlight on the brutal and racist policing behaviors of our nationwide network of local law enforcement agencies, as well as the dangers of a police force that is heavily militarized and which is not held accountable for its actions. In cities across the US, police have been deploying chemical weapons, vehicles, and ostensibly non-lethal rounds, against peaceful protesters, children, bystanders, and members of the press. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      As roboticists, we are incredibly lucky that the list of tools of brutality deployed this past week has not included robotic technologies that police forces have otherwise begun to adopt, including police forces in Colorado. We may not be so lucky in the future.

      In order for us to maintain the trust of our communities, it may thus be important for us to make clear to the public that we do not support, and refuse to actively facilitate, the use of robots to further militarize our police. In service of that goal, we agree to refuse to participate in research collaborations with State and Local Law Enforcement agencies (or national agencies such as ICE), and/or agreeing to refuse to pursue or accept funding for research projects whose express goal is development of robotic technologies or AI technologies (e.g., nonconsensual face recognition technologies, predictive policing models, etc.) whose primary or intended use would be for use by such agencies.
